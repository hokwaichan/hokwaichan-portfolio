          <h3>About the Project</h3>
          <p>
            Manoa Trade Your Stuff is a team project for ICS 314. The aim of
            this project is to establish a marketplace that facilitates the
            buying and selling of campus-specific goods and services for the
            students, faculty, and staff of UHM in a hassle-free and efficient
            manner. The system enables users to easily search and browse through
            the available items and create their own listings to sell.
            Additionally, it comprises user profiles, categorization of
            different types of items, and a reporting mechanism to flag any
            inappropriate activity. The ultimate goal is to establish a secure,
            user-friendly, and productive platform that encourages UHM students
            to recycle and reuse campus-specific goods and services.
          </p>

          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            Throughout the course of this project, I have acquired a multitude
            of valuable skills and knowledge. Firstly, I learned how to
            effectively collaborate with my teammates. Secondly, I gained
            experience in creating a website using Meteor React, which included
            designing the layout, implementing functionality, and adding various
            features. I also learned how to handle merge conflicts, an essential
            skill for team-based development. Additionally, I was introduced to
            TestCafe, which enabled me to test the program and ensure that it
            was functioning correctly. Moreover, I gained experience in
            deploying a website, which involved setting up a server and
            deploying the application to it. Lastly, I learned how to break down
            a project into a series of milestones, which helped us work more
            efficiently and complete the project within the given timeline.
            Overall, this project was an excellent opportunity to acquire and
            refine various skills that will be useful in my future career.
