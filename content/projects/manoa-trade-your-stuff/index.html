          <h3>About the Project</h3>
          <p>
            Manoa Trade Your Stuff is a team project for ICS 314 that creates a
            specialized marketplace for the University of Hawaii at Manoa
            community. The platform facilitates the buying and selling of
            campus-specific goods and services, making it easier for students,
            faculty, and staff to trade items within the UHM community.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Features</h3>
          <p>
            The platform offers a comprehensive set of features designed to
            create a seamless trading experience. Users can easily browse and
            search through available items using our intuitive interface. The
            system includes a robust user profile system that allows members to
            manage their listings and personal information. Items are carefully
            categorized for easy navigation, and the platform includes secure
            listing creation and management tools. To maintain a safe trading
            environment, we implemented a reporting system for inappropriate
            content, and the entire interface is designed to be responsive
            across all devices.
          </p>

          <h3>My Contributions</h3>
          <p>
            As a key member of the development team, I was responsible for
            several critical components of the platform:
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Profile Management System, I developed the Add Profile page
            for new user registration, created the Edit Profile functionality
            for user information updates, and implemented the Profile Page for
            displaying user information. These features were essential for
            creating a personalized experience for each user.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the User Interface Optimization, I focused on enhancing the
            overall user experience. I improved the Item List to make browsing
            more efficient, reorganized the Categories Page for better
            navigation, and optimized the Item List Page to ensure smooth
            performance. These improvements made the platform more user-friendly
            and accessible to the UHM community.
          </p>

          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            This project provided me with valuable experience in full-stack web
            development and team collaboration. I gained hands-on experience
            with modern web technologies, including full-stack development using
            Meteor and React, database management with MongoDB, and automated
            testing with TestCafe. The project also taught me important skills
            in version control and merge conflict resolution, as well as website
            deployment and server management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond technical skills, I developed crucial professional
            competencies through this project. I learned effective team
            collaboration and communication strategies, gained experience in
            project planning and milestone management, and developed skills in
            code review and quality assurance. The project also deepened my
            understanding of user experience design principles, which has been
            valuable in my subsequent work.
          </p>

          <h3>Project Impact</h3>
          <p>
            The platform successfully created a sustainable marketplace for the
            UHM community, promoting the reuse and recycling of campus-specific
            items. The project demonstrated the practical application of web
            development skills in creating a real-world solution that benefits
            the university community. By providing a dedicated platform for
            campus trading, we helped reduce waste and foster a more sustainable
            campus environment.
