          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            In Archer's Quest, players must strategically choose which skills to
            pursue based on their gameplay style or the challenges they
            anticipate facing with the final boss. Each player begins with a
            basic bow and a set of arrows, setting the stage for an engaging
            adventure.
          </p>
          <h3>Key Features</h3>
          <div class="feature-list">
            <div class="feature-item">
              <div>
                <h4>Catch the Capsule</h4>
                <p>
                  This field requires precision and timing to catch moving
                  targets, challenging players to hone their reflexes.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-item">
              <div>
                <h4>Maze Runner</h4>
                <p>
                  Focuses on navigation and quick decision-making, as players
                  navigate through complex mazes.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="feature-item">
              <div>
                <h4>Shooting Arena</h4>
                <p>
                  Players refine their aiming and shooting skills in this field,
                  preparing for the challenges ahead.
                </p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Skill Acquisition</h3>
          <p>
            Players are allowed to choose only two fields to enter, where they
            gain skills or items that significantly influence their abilities in
            the final battle. This strategic choice adds depth to the gameplay,
            as players must consider which skills will best serve them against
            the final boss.
          </p>
          <h3>Final Boss</h3>
          <p>
            The final boss presents a challenging encounter that requires a
            combination of the skills learned throughout the game. This
            climactic battle tests the player's strategic planning and
            execution, making for an exciting conclusion to the quest.
          </p>
          <div class="project-images">
            <img
              src="images/combat.png"
              alt="Archer's Quest Combat"
              class="featured-image"
            />
          </div>
          <h3>Feedback</h3>
          <p>
            Implementing six fields and a final boss field is too time-consuming
            as each field is like a new game.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aiming and shooting without a crosshair is very challenging and
            needs a mouse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Improvements are needed on teleports, as there are too many
            accidents in teleporting between fields.
          </p>
