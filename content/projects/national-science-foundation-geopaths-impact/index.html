          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            As a participant in the National Science Foundation Geopaths -
            Impact program during Fall 2021, I had the opportunity to contribute
            to the KCC STEM community through various leadership roles and
            technical projects. The program focused on developing professional
            skills and making meaningful contributions to the STEM community.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Responsibilities</h3>
          <p>
            During my time with the program, I actively participated in various
            STEM community events, including the STEM Expo and Student
            Undergraduate Research Fair (SURF). These experiences allowed me to
            develop strong leadership skills while contributing to the success
            of these important community events.
          </p>
          <p>
            A significant part of my role involved designing and developing
            event pages for the KCC STEM website. I focused on creating
            user-friendly interfaces and implementing SEO best practices to
            ensure the website was both accessible and discoverable by the
            community.
          </p>

          <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            Using the Elementor website builder, I created and maintained event
            pages for the KCC STEM website. The implementation process involved
            careful consideration of user experience and technical requirements.
            I focused on creating responsive layouts that would work seamlessly
            across different devices, from desktop computers to mobile phones.
          </p>
          <p>
            The website development process required a deep understanding of
            both technical and design principles. I implemented intuitive
            navigation systems and user interfaces that made it easy for
            visitors to find the information they needed. Additionally, I
            ensured that all content met accessibility standards, making the
            website usable for everyone in the community.
          </p>

          <h3>Impact and Learning</h3>
          <p>
            This experience provided valuable opportunities for both personal
            and professional growth. Through event coordination and community
            engagement, I developed strong leadership skills that have continued
            to benefit me in subsequent projects and roles. The hands-on
            experience with web development using Elementor gave me practical
            insights into modern website creation and management.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most valuable lessons from this experience was learning
            to balance technical requirements with user needs. This skill has
            proven invaluable in my later projects, helping me create solutions
            that are both technically sound and user-friendly. The project
            management and communication skills I developed during this time
            have also been crucial in my professional development.
