          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The Digital Ammunition Counter is an innovative solution developed
            for the 25th Infantry Division, designed to enhance the accuracy and
            efficiency of ammunition counting processes. This project combines
            hardware and software components to create a reliable and
            user-friendly system for tracking ammunition inventory.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Features</h3>
          <p>
            The system features a sophisticated object detection algorithm
            powered by TensorFlow, capable of accurately identifying and
            counting different types of ammunition. The hardware component,
            built with Arduino, provides a stable platform for the camera and
            processing unit, while the Python-based software ensures reliable
            data processing and storage.
          </p>

          <p>
            The user interface is designed for simplicity and efficiency,
            allowing operators to quickly view current counts, historical data,
            and generate reports. The system also includes error detection
            mechanisms to ensure accurate counting and alert operators of any
            discrepancies.
          </p>

          <h3>Technical Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            The project utilizes a combination of computer vision and machine
            learning techniques to achieve high accuracy in ammunition counting.
            The TensorFlow model was trained on a diverse dataset of ammunition
            images, enabling it to recognize various types and conditions of
            ammunition. The Arduino microcontroller manages the hardware
            components, including the camera module and display interface, while
            the Python backend handles data processing and storage.
          </p>

          <p>
            The system architecture is modular, allowing for easy updates and
            maintenance. The hardware components are designed to be durable and
            suitable for field conditions, while the software implementation
            prioritizes reliability and ease of use. Data is stored securely and
            can be accessed through a simple interface, making it easy for
            operators to track inventory changes over time.
          </p>

          <h3>Development Process</h3>
          <p>
            The development process began with extensive research into existing
            ammunition counting methods and their limitations. This was followed
            by the design and implementation of the hardware prototype, which
            underwent multiple iterations to ensure reliability and durability.
            The software development phase focused on creating an accurate and
            efficient counting algorithm, with particular attention to edge
            cases and error handling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Testing was conducted in various conditions to ensure the system's
            reliability and accuracy. The feedback from these tests was used to
            refine both the hardware and software components, resulting in a
            robust and user-friendly system.
          </p>

          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>
            The Digital Ammunition Counter has demonstrated significant
            improvements in counting accuracy and efficiency. The system reduces
            the time required for inventory checks while maintaining high
            accuracy levels. User feedback has been positive, with operators
            noting the system's reliability and ease of use. The project has
            successfully met its objectives of improving the ammunition counting
            process for the 25th Infantry Division.
