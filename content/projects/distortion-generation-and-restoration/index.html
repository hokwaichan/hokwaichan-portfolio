          <h3>About the Project</h3>
          <p>
            This project focused on developing a comprehensive solution for
            complex image distortion restoration, contributing to an ICIP
            conference publication. The work involved creating a large-scale
            dataset and implementing a neural model capable of predicting and
            correcting various types of image distortions. The project aimed to
            advance the field of image restoration by providing both the tools
            for generating synthetic distortions and the means to restore them.
          </p>

          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            Through this project, I gained extensive experience in image
            processing and deep learning techniques. I developed expertise in
            implementing various distortion algorithms, including radial and
            vortex distortions, as well as smooth random field generation. The
            project enhanced my understanding of UV mapping and displacement
            fields, crucial concepts in image processing and computer vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Working with OpenCV and Perlin noise for distortion generation gave
            me practical experience in creating complex image transformations. I
            also learned about the challenges and solutions in training
            regression models for image restoration tasks, particularly in
            handling different types of distortions and evaluating model
            performance using various metrics.
          </p>

          <h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
          <p>
            The project utilized a sophisticated stack of tools and
            technologies. OpenCV served as the primary library for implementing
            distortion techniques and image processing operations. We developed
            custom algorithms for generating radial and vortex distortions, as
            well as smooth random fields using Perlin noise. The UV displacement
            maps were carefully designed to capture the complex nature of image
            distortions.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the neural network implementation, we used a ResNet-based
            architecture (UVNet) specifically designed for regression tasks. The
            model was trained using supervised learning techniques, with the
            generated UV displacement maps serving as ground truth data. We
            implemented comprehensive evaluation metrics including L1 loss, MSE,
            and PSNR to assess model performance.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
          <p>
            The project successfully created a large-scale dataset for complex
            image distortion restoration, which has been prepared for internal
            team use and ICIP conference submission. The UVNet model
            demonstrated promising results in predicting distortion fields from
            RGB input images, showing the potential for practical applications
            in image restoration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The automated distortion pipeline we developed streamlined the
            process of generating synthetic datasets, making it easier for the
            team to create and experiment with different types of distortions.
            The project's contributions to the field of image restoration have
            been recognized through its acceptance for presentation at the ICIP
            conference.
