          <h3>Project Overview</h3>
          <p>
            The assignment is to build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for a
            Pokemon species hierarchy program in Java.
          </p>

          <h3>What is GUI?</h3>
          <p>
            A graphic user interface (GUI) is a tool for people to interact with
            a computer utilizing visual components like buttons, text fields,
            and windows. When compared to using command-line input and output,
            this technique is more user-friendly. The Swing library is one of
            several Java libraries that may be used to create graphical user
            interface (GUI) applications. These libraries include a large
            variety of components and are highly helpful for developing visual
            programs.
          </p>

          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            Through this project, I have learned a lot about creating a 2D frame
            using a Graphical User Interface (GUI), a crucial ability for making
            user-friendly applications. I used a variety of in-class methods to
            increase the program's interactivity and enjoyment. For instance,
            sorting the caught and encountered Pokemon which is a major part of
            the program was accomplished using data structures like stack and
            priority queue. Through this project, I have also learned how to
            differentiate between various data formats and apply sorting
            strategies efficiently. More importantly, it has improved my ability
            to create GUIs.
