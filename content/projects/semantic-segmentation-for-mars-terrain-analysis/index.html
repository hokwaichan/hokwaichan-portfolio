          <h3>About the Project</h3>
          <p>
            This research project focuses on developing advanced perception
            systems for autonomous planetary exploration through semantic
            segmentation of Mars terrain. The goal was to improve terrain
            classification and analysis capabilities for Mars rovers using deep
            learning techniques. By implementing state-of-the-art computer
            vision models and 3D reconstruction techniques, we aimed to create a
            robust system for analyzing and understanding Martian terrain
            features.
          </p>

          <h3>What I Learned</h3>
          <p>
            Through this project, I gained extensive experience in computer
            vision and deep learning applications. I developed a deep
            understanding of semantic segmentation models and their practical
            applications in analyzing complex terrain features. The project
            provided hands-on experience with 3D reconstruction techniques using
            COLMAP, allowing me to understand how to create detailed terrain
            models from 2D images. I also learned about synthetic data
            generation using Infinigen, which proved crucial for augmenting our
            training dataset with realistic Mars-like terrains.
          </p>
          <p>
            The implementation of DeepLabV3 gave me practical experience in
            fine-tuning deep learning models for specific use cases. I learned
            to handle challenges unique to planetary terrain analysis, such as
            dealing with low contrast images and similar textures across
            different surface elements. This project significantly enhanced my
            understanding of how to apply computer vision techniques to
            real-world problems in space exploration.
          </p>

          <h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
          <p>
            The project utilized a comprehensive set of tools and technologies.
            DeepLabV3 served as our primary model for semantic segmentation,
            chosen for its effectiveness in handling complex visual tasks. We
            implemented COLMAP for 3D reconstruction, which helped us better
            understand terrain structures from 2D images. For data augmentation,
            we used Infinigen, a procedural generator that created synthetic
            training data with realistic Mars-like features.
          </p>
          <p>
            The S5Mars dataset, containing 6,000 images with ground truth masks,
            formed the foundation of our training data. We implemented the
            project using Python as our primary programming language and PyTorch
            as our deep learning framework. This combination of tools allowed us
            to create a robust and efficient system for Mars terrain analysis.
          </p>

          <h3>Key Achievements</h3>
          <p>
            The project achieved several significant milestones. We successfully
            implemented a semantic segmentation system that achieved 74%
            validation accuracy on Mars terrain classification, a promising
            result given the challenges of the task. The system demonstrated
            robust performance in identifying various terrain features, from
            rocks and sand to more complex elements like ridges and holes.
          </p>
          <p>
            We successfully evaluated and compared multiple state-of-the-art
            models, ultimately developing a comprehensive pipeline for Mars
            terrain analysis. The system proved capable of handling complex
            terrain features and provided valuable insights for future planetary
            exploration missions. These achievements demonstrate the potential
            of deep learning techniques in advancing autonomous planetary
            exploration capabilities.
